## 🎯 Project Vision & Purpose

### Core Mission
GitRead is an AI agent that reads any public GitHub repository and outputs structured, comprehensive project documentation. Unlike static scripts, GitRead operates as part of a **self-evolving agent ecosystem** that continuously improves through:

- 📚 **AI Learning Context** (`Learn_AI/`) – Knowledge about AI and agent design
- 📁 **Project Documentation** (`Project Docs/`) – Plans, iterations, and outputs
- 🔄 **Regeneration Blocks** – Structured feedback for continuous improvement

### Unique Value Proposition
1. **Meta-Prompting Architecture** - Explicit agent roles and context
2. **Prompt Chaining Workflow** - Sequential validation and refinement
3. **Quality Assurance Integration** - Automated review and scoring
4. **Test Generation Capability** - Automated test creation and validation
5. **Self-Improvement Mechanism** - Regeneration blocks for iterative enhancement

---

## 🧠 Core Design Principles (DX Engineering)

### 1. Unit Work Principle
- Break tasks into composable, single-responsibility chunks
- Each agent handles one specific aspect (cloning, parsing, planning, etc.)
- Modular design enables independent testing and improvement

### 2. Prompt Chaining Strategy
- **Phase 1:** Repository Analysis (Clone → Parse → Context)
- **Phase 2:** Documentation Generation (Outline → Sections → Format)
- **Phase 3:** Test Generation (Strategy → Implementation → Validation)
- **Phase 4:** Quality Review (Assessment → Scoring → Recommendations)
- **Phase 5:** Regeneration Block (Metrics → Feedback → Next Steps)

### 3. Meta-Prompting Framework
- Frame LLM role with explicit identity and context
- Define success criteria and quality standards
- Provide domain-specific knowledge and constraints

### 4. Self-Correction Mechanism
- Review agent evaluates output quality across multiple dimensions
- Regeneration blocks capture improvement opportunities
- Historical context informs future iterations

### 5. Tool Integration
- Real engineering tools (`git`, file parsing, validation)
- External API integration (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Quality validation scripts and test frameworks

### 6. User Alignment
- Fallback to knowledge base when uncertain
- Clear error reporting and status communication
- Configurable pipeline phases and options
