- **Storage**: SSD for faster build times

### Step-by-Step Installation

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/gitread_Spoon-Knife.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd gitread_Spoon-Knife
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies

#### Step 3: Verify Installation

#### Step 4: Environment Setup

1. **Copy environment template:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables** (see Configuration section)

3. **Initialize database** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   # Run database migrations
   npm run migrate
   # or for Python projects
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

## Configuration Required

This section outlines all necessary configuration steps to ensure the application runs correctly in your environment. Proper configuration is essential for security, performance, and functionality.

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to configure the application for different environments (development, staging, production) and to store sensitive information securely.

#### Required Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and configure the following variables:

```bash
# Application Settings
APP_ENV=development
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_PORT=3000

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string

# API Keys and Secrets
API_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key
```

### Build Configuration

### Security Configuration

#### Important Security Notes

- **Never commit** `.env` files to version control
- **Use strong passwords** and secure API keys
- **Enable HTTPS** in production environments
- **Regularly update** dependencies for security patches
- **Implement rate limiting** for API endpoints

#### Environment-Specific Settings
